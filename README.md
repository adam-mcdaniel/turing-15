# turing-15
The version of the language that helped win our team the Innovation in Controls Award at the FRC Smokey Mountain Regionals.

## DO NOT USE THIS

This language is not meant to be used on the Roborio anymore, and we've stopped supporting it. Originally, it was very useful in 
making code that could transpile to Python or C++, but it became too cumbersome to add features to the transpiler.

All the `.tr` files are turing scripts, and `main.py` is the actual transpiler.

If you're interested, take a look; however, the code for this project was rushed, and the code for my new programming 
languages is much more elegant. I'd look at those instead :)
